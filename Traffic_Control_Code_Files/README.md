# Traffic Control System
The motive of the project was to build a miniature traffic control model for both vehicle and pedestrian traffic. 
Complete circuit connections were made for all the components like ICs, LEDs, buzzers, and sensors using an Arduino Uno. 
The project consists of code written for system modifications as well as for setup of ICs and sensors with the Arduino.
